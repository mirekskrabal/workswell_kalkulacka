* zadani ulohy kalkulacka
 cilem je procvicit zaklady QT frameworku na jednoduche aplikaci - QML frontend, c++ backend,
 propojeni cpp a QML, responzivni frontend pomoci Javascriptu
 Vytvoreni aplikace(QT Quick Application) Kalkulacka

 Moznosti kalkulacky:
  • Klasicka kalkulacka, jako ma windows/mac OS. Napriklad:
  • Bude mozne klikat na cisla jako na tlacitka a nebo psat za pomoci numlock klavesnice
  • Science mode, kde po zapnuti pribude cely radek s vedeckymi funkcemi -sinus, cosinus, tangenc,
    cotangenc, logaritmus a exponenciala etc.
  • Po zmacknuti tlacitka “=” bude mozne pokracovat v praci s vysledkem
  • Moznost retezit operace za sebou
  • Ukladani mezivysledku do pameti
  • Dalsi moznosti muzete pridat dle zvazeni
	
  Pozadavky na aplikaci:
  • vypocty budou provadeny v backend c++ tride, pouziti context property (kalkulacku zle udelat ciste v qml a js)
  • funkcni a uzivatelsky prijemny frontend - pozor na zmeny velikosti oken, pozicovani, layouty

* qt quick module
  lib for writing qml apps
  provides basic types for creating user interfaces (ui, animating, views..)
** visual canvas
   two dimensional canvas with z-ordering
   top-left pixel is the [0,0] pixel
   visual parent:
   - owenership-parent - determines obj lifetime semantics
   - visual-parent - determines where on the canvas an item is drawn)

** positioning
   anchoring:
   - items are anchored to each other at certain boundaries
   - items can placed adjacent or inside of another (by attaching one or
   more of the items anchor-points to an anchor=point of he other)
   - more efficient than binding-based layouts

*** z-order
    ordering of overlapping 2d objects
    determines which window appears on top of the other (order on the z
    axis)
*** states
    how and where the individual component parts of the visual item are
    displayed within it, and all the data associated with that state

*** transitions
    "edge" between two states
    may trigger other events

* qt qml
  framework for develoiping apps and libs with qml language
  qml - user interface specification and programming language
  support for impertaive js expressions combined with dynamic property binding
  qt quick - std lib of types and functionality for qmljjjj
 
*** item type
    all visual items provided by qt quick are based on the item type, which
    provides a common set of attribute for visual items, including opacity
    and transform attributes

*** transforms
    qt quick types have built-in support for transformations
    //if you wish to have zour visual content roated or scaled, you can set the Item::rotation or Item::scale property

** model/view programming
   classes that manage the relationship between data and the way it is presented to the user

** anchoring
   each item can be thought of as having a set of 7 invisible "anchor lines" 
   - left, horizontalCenter, right, top, verticalCenter, baseline, bottom


*** concept
    table of buttons anchored to bottom of the window
    - provides number, operators etc. which user interacts with

* Connecting c++ and qml
  c++ objects and values can be embedded directly into the context of loaded qml objects using context properties
  and context objects - this is achieved through the *QQmlContext* class which exposes data to the context of a QML
  component, allowing data to be injected from C++ into QML
  QQmlContext class:
  - exposes data to the context of a qml object so that the data can be referred to directly
    from within the scope of the qml code
  - each QQmlContext contains a set of properties, distinct from its QObject properties, that allow data
    to be explicitly bound to a context by name
  context form a hierarchy - root is qml engine's root context (data that should be available to all all qml
  component instances instantiated by the engine should be pt in the root context)
  - additional data that should be available to a subset of component instances should be added to sub-contexts
    parented to the root context
    - child contexts inherit the context properties of their parents
** context properties
   expose context properties via setContextProperty method
   possible to expose value types supperted by QVariant and pointer to QObjects
** context objects
   to simplify binding and maintaining large data sets, all properites of an obj can be exposed with
   *setContextObject* -> all the properties of the context obj are available by name in the context
  
  when a QObject instance is exposed with setContextProperty, the obj's properties, signals, slots, methods
  market with Q_INVOKABLE, and enums registered with Q_ENUM, are accessible from QML
    
** signal and handler event system
   signal - event X signal handler - response
   when a signal is emitted, corespoding signal handler is invoked
   
** defining custom qml object types
   placed in <TypeName>.qml file

**  notations
    infix 2 + 2
    postfix 2 2 +
    prefix + 2 2
